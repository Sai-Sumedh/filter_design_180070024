The following files contain the functions required:
1. normalized_freq_spec.sci
2. bilinear_transform.sci
3. freq_transform_analog.sci
4. analog_lpf_parameters.sci
5. poles_lpf.sci
6. fir_lpf_impulse_response.sci
(they also have lots of commented code which was used to test the functions)


And the following files contain the code used to obtain parameters and generate plots:
1. iir_filter_design.sce
2. fir_filter_design.sce
